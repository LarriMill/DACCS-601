# HW 2
This assignment uses code from HW1 to import a dataset and view its first few rows. The dataset used for this assignment is scdb.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

# Reading in the data 
scdbData <- read.delim("scdb.csv", sep = ",", header  = TRUE)

# This object is named "scdbData" because it holds data from the Supreme Court Database (scdb)
# The file, scdb.csv, is already in my working directory
# The delimiter is "," due to the file being a CSV (comma-separated value)
# The header is "TRUE" because there is a header in the data with variable names

# Checking the first few rows
head(scdbData)

#the head() function returns the variable names & the first few rows of the data file
```

This dataset, called scdb, is a database of the Supreme Court's decisions from its first in 1791 through 2018. More information about this dataset can be accessed at (http://scdb.wustl.edu/) 

scdb has `r nrow(scdbData)` observations (rows) and `r ncol(scdbData)` variables (columns).
